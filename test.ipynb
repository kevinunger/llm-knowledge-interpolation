The filming took place at Oheka Castle on Long Island , off the coast of the eastern United States. It features Ora in a red dress walking and running in the garden and Payne in the castle, with them meeting on the grand staircase at the end. Special effects throughout also show the pair levitating. Comparisons were drawn to the video of \" Blank Space \" by Taylor Swift , as both videos were filmed in the same location.
